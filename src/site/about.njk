<h2 id="about-me">ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by</h2>
<p>
  I have been working in the field of quantum computation for almost a decade.
</p>
<p>
 I am a postdoctoral associate in the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/">QuICS</a> at University of Maryland. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&pli=1&user=Xnm7lvQAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=atul+mantri&source=header&searchtype=all">arXiv</a>.
</p>
<p>
My research interests lie in the field of quantum computation and quantum information. I have actively worked on the design of delegated quantum computing protocols and questions related to quantum foundations.  
</p>
<p>
In particular, I am interested in the interplay of cryptography and quantum correlations in various quantum cryptographic tasks.
